2002-05-14  Niels Möller  <niels@s3.kth.se>

	* x86/aes-encrypt.asm (aes_encrypt): Move code here...
	* x86/aes.asm: ...from here.	

	* x86/aes.asm: Use addl and subl, not add and sub. Replaced
	references to dtbl1-4 with references to _aes_encrypt_table.

	* configure.ac (asm_path): Enable x86 assembler.

	* x86/aes.asm (aes_decrypt): Adapted to the current interface.
	Notably, the order of the subkeys was reversed. Single block
	encrypt/decrypt works now.
	(aes_encrypt, aes_decrypt): Added an outer loop, so that we can
	encrypt more than one block at a time.

2002-05-07  Niels Möller  <niels@s3.kth.se>

	* configure.ac: Generate config.m4.

	* x86/aes.asm: Use C for comments, include the tables using
	include_src, and commented out the key setup functions.
	Fixed the processing of the first handling of the round function.
	Now, encryption of a single block works! Multiple blocks, and
	decryption, is still broken.

	* x86/machine.m4: New file (empty).

	* x86/aes-encrypt.asm: New file, empty for now.

	* Makefile.am (%.asm): Added asm.m4, machine.m4 and config.m4 to

	* asm.m4 (C, include_src): New macros.

	* aes-encrypt-table.c: New file, table moved out from
	aes-encrypt.c. 

2002-05-06  Niels Möller  <niels@s3.kth.se>

	* configure.in (asm_path): AC_CONFIG_LINKS adds $srcdir
	automatically. 

2002-03-14  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* Makefile.am (libnettle_a_SOURCES): Added aes-internal.h.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added assembler files.

	* configure.in (asm_path): Use $srcdir when looking for the files.

	Bumped version to 1.6.

2002-02-25  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Moved increment of src into the
	source_loop. Also fixed stop condition, the loop was run 5 times,
	not 4, as it should.
	(_aes_crypt): Use src directly when accessing the source data,
	don't use %o5.
	(_aes_crypt): Renamed variables in source_loop.
	(_aes_crypt): Changed stop condition in source_loop to not depend
	on i. Finally reduced the source_loop to 16 instructions. Also

	(_aes_crypt): In final_loop, construct the result in t0. Use t0-t3
	for intermediate values.

	get to the current roundkey.

	instructions.
	(_aes_crypt): Reformatted code as blocks of four instructions
	each.

	using the subkey pointer.

2002-02-19  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* configure.in (asm_path): Renamed "path" to "asm_path". Also look
	for a machine.m4.

2002-02-16  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm: Use that IDX2(j) == j ^ 2

	* Makefile.am (libnettle_a_SOURCES): Reordered aes-decrypt.c and
	aes-encrypt.c. For some strange reason it makes the benchmark go
	faster... 

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Use double-buffering, and no
	separate loop for adding the round key.
	(round): Keep round index muliplied by 16, so it can be used
	directly for indexing the subkeys.
	(_aes_crypt): In the final loop, use ctx+round to access the
	subkeys, no need for an extra register.

2002-02-15  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Renaming variables, allocating
	locals starting from %l0.
	(_aes_crypt): Consistently use %l4, aka i, as the variable for the
	innermost loops.
	(_aes_crypt): Moved reading of ctx->nrounds out of the loop.
	(_aes_crypt): In final_loop, deleted a redundant mov, and use i as
	loop variable.
	(_aes_crypt): Started renumbering registers in the inner loop. The
	computation for the table[j] sub-expression should be kept in
	register %o[j].
	(_aes_crypt): Renamed more variables in the inner loop. Now the
	primary variables are t0, t1, t2, t3.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Swapped register %i0 and %o5, %i1
	and %o0, %i2 and %o4, %i3 and %o3, %i4 and %o2.
	(_aes_crypt): wtxt was stored in both %l1 and %l2 for the entire
	function. Freed %l2 for other uses.
	(_aes_crypt): Likewise for tmp, freeing register %o1.	

	* sparc/machine.m4: New file, for sparc-specific macros.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Hacked the source_loop, to get rid
	of yet another redundant loop variable, and one instruction.
	(_aes_crypt): Strength reduce loop variable in the
	inner loop, getting rid of one register.
	(_aes_crypt): Use pre-shifted indices (aes_table.idx_shift), to
	avoid some shifts in the inner loop.
	(_aes_crypt): Don't check for nrounds==0 at the start of the loop.

	* asm.m4: Define and use structure-defining macros.

	* Makefile.am (%.asm): Use a GNU pattern rule, to make %.o depend
	on both %.asm and asm.m4.

	* aes-internal.h (struct aes_table): New subtable idx_shift.
	Updated tables in aes_encrypt.c and aes_decrypt.c.

	* asm.m4: Use eval to compute values.

	and aes_set_decrypt_key.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Use symbolic names for the fucntion
	arguments. 

2002-02-14  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm: Copied gcc assembler code for _aes_crypt.

	* aes-internal.h (struct aes_table): New structure, including all
	constant tables needed by the unified encryption or decryption
	function _aes_crypt.

	* aes.c (_aes_crypt): New function, which unifies encryption and
	decryption.

	AES key setup now uses two separate functions for setting
	encryption and decryption keys. Applications that don't do
	decryption need no inverted subkeys and no code to generate them.
	Similarly, the tables (about 4K each for encryption and
	decryption), are put into separate files.

	* aes.h (struct aes_ctx): Deleted space for inverse subkeys. For
	decryption, the inverse subkeys replace the normal subkeys, and
	they are stored _in the order they are used_. 

	* aes-set-key.c (aes_set_key): Deleted file, code moved...
	* aes-set-decrypt-key.c, aes-set-encrypt-key.c: New files,
	separated normal and inverse key setup.

	* sparc/aes.asm (idx, aes_encrypt): Multiplied tabled values by 4,
	making it possible to get rid of some shifts in the inner loop.

	* configure.in: Fixed spelling of --enable-assembler. Commented
	out debug echo:s.

	* rsa-decrypt.c, rsa-encrypt.c: New files for rsa pkcs#1
	encryption. 

	* aes-set-key.c, aes-tables.c: New files, split off from aes.c.

	* aes-internal.h: New file.

	* cast128-meta.c (_NETTLE_CIPHER_FIX): Use _NETTLE_CIPHER_FIX. 

	* cbc.c (cbc_decrypt_internal): New function, doing the real CBC

	* examples/nettle-benchmark.c (display): New function for
	displaying the results, including MB/s figures.
