<h1>Nettle - a low-level cryptographic library</h1>

<blockquote>
  Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more
  or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages
  (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in
  kernel space.

<h2> Documentation </h2>

A complete manual is included if you download the Nettle source code.
You can also <a href="nettle.html">read the manual online</a>.

<h2> Download </h2>

Get the latest version by <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/archive/">http</a> or <a
href="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/security/lsh">ftp</a>. Nettle is
also included with the latest development versions of <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/lsh">lsh</a>.

<h2> Language bindings </h2>

<p> I'm aware of nettle-bindings for the following higher-level
  languages.
  <dl>
    <dt> <a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se">Pike</a></dt>
    <dd> An object-oriented interpreted language with C-like syntax.
      Nettle bindings are included with the official distribution.</dd>
    <dt> <a href='http://www.yellowbank.com/code/PostgreSQL/y_crypto/'>PostgreSQL</a></dt>
    <dd> Bindings for the Postgres database, by Ron Peterson </dd>
    <dt> <a href='http://marcomaggi.github.com/nausicaa.html'>R6RS
	Scheme</a></dt>
    <dd> Scheme bindings by Marco Maggi, supporting multiple R6RS implementations.</dd>
    <dt> TCL </dt>
    <dd> Included in the chiark-tcl debian package by Ian Jackson (not
      sure if/how it's distributed outside of debian). </dd>
  </dl>
  Mail me for corrections or additions to this list.

<h2> CVS access </h2>

As some shared but crucial files are not stored in the Nettle corner
of the CVS repository, the recommended way of CVS access is to check
out the entire LSH tree, as per the instructions at the <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/lsh">LSH home page</a>, run the
top-level <tt>./.bootstrap</tt> script (which sets up a few important
symlinks and runs .bootstrap scripts in subdirectories), and then
descend into the <tt>nettle</tt> directory for a standard
<tt>./configure && make</tt> there.

<h2> Contact </h2>

Send mail to the <a
href='http://lists.lysator.liu.se/mailman/listinfo/nettle-bugs'><tt>nettle-bugs</tt>
mailinglist</a> or directly to me at <a
href="mailto:nisse@lysator.liu.se"><tt>&lt;nisse@lysator.liu.se&gt;</tt></a>
if you have any questions.
