NEWS for the 2.0 release

	This release breaks binary compatibility by splitting the
	library into two. Some other smaller changes that are not
	backwards compatible are also done at the same time.

	* The nettle library is split into two libraries, libnettle
	  and libhogweed. libnettle contains the symmetric crypto
	  algorithms that don't depend on GMP, while libhogweed
	  contains the public key algorithms that depend on GMP.
	  Using a single library worked fine with static linking, but
	  not with dynamic linking. Consider an application that uses
	  nettle and which doesn't use any public key cryptography. If
	  this application is linked dynamically to nettle, it would
	  have to be linked also with GMP if and only if public key
	  support was enabled when the nettle library was installed.

	  The library names are libnettle.so.3.0 and
	  libhogweed.so.1.0, with sonames libnettle.so.3 and
	  libhogweed.so.1.

	* Function typedefs have been changed to non-pointer types.
	  E.g, the

	    typedef void (nettle_hash_init_func *)(void *ctx);

	  of previous versions is replaced by

	    typedef void (nettle_hash_init_func)(void *ctx);

	  This makes it possible to use the type when declaring
	  functions, like

	    nettle_hash_init_func foo_hash_init;

	    void foo_hash_init(void *ctx) { ... }

	* Changes to the yarrow256 interface. The automatic seed file
	  generation, and the seed_file member in struct
	  yarrow256_ctx, has been removed. To generate a new seed
	  file, use yarrow256_random. The function
	  yarrow256_force_reseed has been replaced by the two
	  functions yarrow256_fast_reseed and yarrow256_slow_reseed,
	  which were previously static. This interface change makes it
	  easier to mix in the current content of the seed file before
	  overwriting it with newly generated data.

	Other changes:

	* The sexp-conv program preserves comments when using the
	  advanced syntax for output. Optionally locks the output
	  file.

	* The base64 decoder recognizes ASCII FF (form feed) and VT
          (vertical tab) as white space.

	* New x86_64 implementations of AES and SHA1. On a 2.2 GHz
          opteron, SHA1 was benchmarked at 250 MByte/s, and AES-128 at
          110 MByte/s.

	* Performance of AES increased by 20-30% on x86.

	* New programs in the examples directory: erathostenes and
          next-prime.
	
NEWS for the 1.15 release

	Added support for PKCS#1 style RSA signatures using SHA256,
	according to RFC 3447. Currently lacks interoperability
	testing.
	
	Header files are now C++ aware, so C++ programs using Nettle
	should now use plain

	  #include <nettle/foo.h>

	rather than

	  #extern "C" {
	  #include <nettle/foo.h>
	  }

	as was the recommendation for the previous version. This
	breaks source-level compatibility with C++, even though
	there's full binary compatibility.

	The file rfc1750.txt (which is considered non-free by debian)
	has been removed from the distribution. The file was used as input
	for the Yarrow testcase, and has been replaced by the short
	story "The Gold-bug" by Edgar Allan Poe. Anyway, RFC 1750 is
	obsoleted by RFC 4086.

	Fixes for Darwin shared library support, contributed by Grant
	Robinsson.

	Example programs now use a supplied getopt.c.

	Configure tests for assemblers with a logarithmic .align
	directive.

	The library is intended to be upwards binary compatible with
	earlier versions. The library name is libnettle.so.2.6, soname
	is still libnettle.so.2.
		
NEWS for the 1.14 release

	Experimental support for reading keys in PKCS#1 ASN1/DER
	format, and a new command line tool pkcs1-conv.
	
	Improved MD5 performance on x86.

	Fixed support for sparc64.

	Reorganized AES code. Better performance for all three
	implementations (C, x86 assembler, sparc assembler).

	New sparc assembler for arcfour. Compared to the code
	generated by gcc, the new code is about 25% faster on old
	sparcs, and 6 times faster on ultrasparc.

	Replaced the internal function nettle_mpz_from_octets with a
	call to mpz_import, if available in the installed GMP library.

	More Makefile fixes; it now seems to work to build with
	the the make programs on Solaris and FreeBSD (although
	--disable-dependency-tracking is required for the latter).

	The library is intended to be binary compatible with earlier
	versions. The library name is libnettle.so.2.5, soname is
	still libnettle.so.2.

NEWS for the 1.13 release

	Fixed problem with broken m4 on bsd, which resulted in
	corrupted x86 assembler for sha1.

	Nettle probably works on windows: I've been able to cross
	compile it with ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc (without
	public-key support), and the testsuite binaries seem to run
	fine in Wine.

	Implemented CTR mode.

	Improved sha1 performance on x86.

	Configure check to figure out if symbols in assembler files
	need a leading underscore.

	Improved benchmark program. Displays cycles per byte and block,
	and compares with openssl (if openssl is installed).
	
	Terminating newline in output from sexp-conv --hash.

	The library is intended to be binary compatible with earlier
	versions. The library name is libnettle.so.2.4. However, the
	interface for the internal function _nettle_sha1_compress has
	changed; any program that calls this function directly will
	break.

NEWS for the 1.12 release
	
	Fixed a bug in the configure script.

	Updated the description of aes_set_encrypt_key and
	aes_set_decrypt_key in the manual.

NEWS for the 1.11 release

	Nettle no longer uses automake. Side effects:

	  * Dependency tracking is enabled only for gcc-3 (help with
	    supporting dependency tracking with other compilers is
	    appreciated).
	  
	  * Makefile compatibility with make programs other than GNU
	    make is mostly unknown, please report any problems.

	Support for arctwo.

	Fixes to the libdes compatibility code. Declarations should
	now match openssl/libdes better. des_cbc_cksum pads
	input with NUL's, if it's not an integral number of blocks (in
	general, such unreversible padding is a bad idea).

	By default, also the static library is compiled as position
	independent code. This is needed on some systems to make it
	possible to link nettle into a dynamically loaded module. Use
	the configure flag --disable-pic if this is not desired.

	Stricter constness typing for the sexp_iterator_assoc and
	sexp_iterator_check_types arguments.

	Minor tweaks of arcfour on x86 cpu:s, to speed it up on older
	x86 variants such as PII and PPro.

	The shared library is intended to be binary compatible with
	nettle-1.8 - nettle-1.10. Only the minor version number of the
	shared library is increased. The soname is still
	libnettle.so.2.

NEWS for the 1.10 release

	Nettle should now compile also on Tru64, Darwin, FreeBSD and
	Windows. (The only tested windows build uses the rntcl rsh
	wrapper to run the command line M$ C compiler "cl". See
	http://pike.ida.liu.se for those tools, I don't know all
	details about the Pike team's windows setup).

	There are some known testsuite failures, on Windows and on one
	of the xenofarm HPUX machines, see
	http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/xeno-lsh/latest.html. Help
	tracking these down is appreciated.

	There are no new features.
	
	This release is intended to be binary compatible with
	nettle-1.8 and nettle-1.9.
	
NEWS for the 1.9 release

	Optimized C implementation of arcfour. Optimized x86
	implementations of arcfour and sha1.

	Improved benchmark program.
	
	Fixed bug in the rsa-encrypt example program.

	Fixed bug in make install, some of the header files were
	forgotten.
	
	Portability fixes. Fixes to make Nettle compile on systems
	without gmp. This version has been tested on GNU/Linux,
	Solaris, HPUX and AIX.

	The shared library is intended to be binary compatible with
	nettle-1.8. Only the minor version number of the shared
	library is increased.

NEWS for the 1.8 release

	New example programs, demonstrating encrypting and decrypting
	files using RSA, and random sessions keys for bulk encryption
	and message authentication.

	Support for systems that don't have alloca. On such systems,
	some of Nettle's functions have arbitrary limits applied to
	their input.

	Uses AX_CREATE_STDINT_H, to support systems without
	inttypes.h.

	Support for the md2 and md4 hash functions.
	 
	New name mangling, to reduce the risk of link collisions. All
	functions (except memxor) now use a nettle_ or _nettle_ prefix
	when seen by the linker. For most functions, the header file
	that declares a function also uses #define to provide a
	shorter more readable name without the prefix.

	The shared library soname for this version is libnettle.so.2.
	
NEWS for the 1.7 release

	Implemented DSA.

	Renamed RSA functions for consistency. Now it's
	rsa_public_key_init, not rsa_init_public_key, etc.

	Both RSA and DSA now have sign/verify functions that take the
	hash digest as argument.

	A rewritten and much more powerful sexp-conv program.

	Other changes to the sexp code, in particular updating it to
	the latest SPKI draft.

	Building nettle as a shared library (ELF only) seems to work.
	The version number is increased, so the library "soname" for
	this release is "libnettle.so.1".

	Bugfixes. Fixes for build and portability problems.

NEWS for the 1.6 release

	Optimized assembler implementations of aes, for sparc and x86.

	The aes interface has changed slightly. The function
	aes_set_key is no more. Instead one has to use
	aes_set_encrypt_key or aes_set_decrypt_key. Sorry about that. 

	New example programs, rsa-keygen, rsa-sign and rsa-verify,
	located in the examples directory.

	New configure option --enable-shared, which builds a shared
	library. Not tested.

	New experimental features, including sexp parsing and
	formatting, and changes to base64 encoding and decoding. The
	interfaces to these functions are subject to change, and are
	documented only in the source code.
	
NEWS for the 1.5 release

	RSA support. Key generation and signatures.
	
	Support for HMAC (RFC-2104).

	An implementation of the Yarrow-256 PRNG.

	New sections in the manual.
	
	Changed the interface for hash functions. The md5_digest
	function is now equivalent to the old sequence of md5_final,
	md5_digest, md5_init, and similarly for the other hashing
	algorithms. This makes the interface simpler.

NEWS for the 1.0 release

	Fixed twofish bug spotted by Jean-Pierre Stierlin.

	Added des3 and cbc.
	
	New RFC-1321-like interface in nettle/md5-compat.h, suggested
	by Assar Westerlund.

	New libdes-style compatibility interface in nettle/des-compat.h.
