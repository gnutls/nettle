  <h1> Nettle release plans </h1>
  <p> This is an attempt at defining a development target for
  Nettle-2.6, inspired by similar pages for recent GMP releases. [Last
  updated 2012-11-29]</p>
  <p class='should'>
    This really ought to be done before release
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    Try to get this done before release
  </p>
  <p class='done'>
    Done!
  </p>
  <p class='postponed'>
    Leave for some later release!
  </p>

  <h1> Plan for the Nettle-2.6 release </h1>
  <h2> Documentation </h2>
  <p class='should'>
    Update documentation with info on SHA3.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Update NEWS file.
  </p>

  <h2> Testing </h2>
  <p> Since xenofarm isn't up and running, do some manual testing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class='should'> x86_64-gnu-linux</li>
    <li class='should'> x86_64-freebsd</li>
    <li class='should'> x86-gnu-linux</li>
    <li class='should'> x86-freebsd</li>
    <li class='should'> x86-w*ndows (using cross compiler and wine)</li>
    <li class='wish'> x86_64-w*ndows (seems a bit harder to get
    mingw64 and wine64 working)</li>
    <li class='should'> sparc32-solaris10</li>
    <li class='should'> sparc64-solaris10</li>
  </ul>

  <h1> Plans for nettle-3.0 </h1>

  <h2> Interface changes </h2>
  <p class='should'>
    Change the type of all lengths from <tt>unsigned</tt>
    to <tt>size_t</tt>. An ABI change on most 64-bit platforms.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Change argument type of memxor and memxor3 from uint8_t * to void
    * (like modern memcpy). Consider them unconditionally part of the
    nettle library, with nettle_ prefix on the symbols, and no
    AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Rename sha256 to sha2_256, and similar for other sha2 functions.
    Split sha.h into sha1.h and sha2.h. For backwards compatibility,
    keep sha.h with old names as aliases.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    For Merkle-Damgaard hash functions, separate the state and the
    buffering. E.g., when using them for HMAC keyed "inner" and
    "outer" states, we now get three buffers but we only need one.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Use the nettle_cipher abstraction only for block ciphers (in
    particular, exclude arcfour). Use a const for the ctx argument to
    nettle_crypt_func.
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    Consider making a public interface similar to nettle_aead? With
    the above change, it can't use nettle_crypt_func.
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    Make it possible to build nettle and hogweed using mini-gmp.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Reorganize private key operations. Need to support RSA with and
    without blinding, and DSA according to spec and some deterministic
    variant (like putty), and possibly also smartcard versions where
    the private key is not available to the library. And without an
    explosion of the number of functions.
