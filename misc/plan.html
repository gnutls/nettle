<title>TODO for coming nettle-2.2 releases</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1> Release plans </h1>
  <p> This is an attempt at defining a development target for
  Nettle-2.5, inspired by similar pages for recent GMP releases.
  [Last updated 2012-04-29]</p>
  <h2> Color codes </h2>
  <p class='should'>
    This really ought to be done before release
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    Try to get this done before release
  </p>
  <p class='done'>
    Done!
  </p>
  <p class='postponed'>
    Leave for some later release!
  </p>

  <h1> Plan for the Nettle-2.5 release </h1>
  <h2> RSA blinding </h2>
  <p class='wish'>
    Add tentative interface, as suggested by Nikos.
  </p>
  <h2> Documentation </h2>
  <p class='should'>
    Update documentation with info on Salsa20.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Update NEWS file.
  </p>
  <h2> Bug fixes </h2>
  <p class='done'>
    Various w64 fixes, mostly by Martin Storsjö.
  </p>
  <h2> Testing </h2>
  <p> Since xenofarm isn't up and running, do some manual testing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class='should'> x86_64-gnu-linux</li>
    <li class='should'> x86_64-freebsd</li>
    <li class='should'> x86-gnu-linux</li>
    <li class='should'> x86-freebsd</li>
    <li class='should'> x86-w*ndows (using cross compiler and wine)</li>
    <li class='wish'> x86_64-w*ndows (seems a bit harder to get
    mingw64 and wine64 working)</li>
    <li class='should'> sparc32-solaris10</li>
    <li class='should'> sparc64-solaris10</li>
  </ul>

  <h1> Plans for nettle-3.0 </h1>

  <h2> Interface changes </h2>
  <p class='should'>
    Change the type of all lengths from <tt>unsigned</tt>
    to <tt>size_t</tt>. An ABI change on most 64-bit platforms.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    For Merkle-Damgaard hash functions, separate the state and the
    buffering. E.g., when using then for HMAC keyed "inner" and
    "outer" states.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Use the nettle_cipher abstraction only for block ciphers (in
    particular, exclude arcfour). Use a const for the ctx argument to
    nettle_crypt_func.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Consider making a public interface similar to nettle_aead? With
    the above change, it can't use nettle_crypt_func.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Reorganize private key operations. Need to support RSA with and
    without blinding, and DSA occording to spec and some deterministic
    variant (putty), and possibly also smartcard versions where the
    private key is not available to the library. And without an
    explosion of the number of functions.
